class ValueIndexes(object):
    """
    An object which contains the indexes for every value in a given array.
    This class is intended to mimic the reverse_indices clause in IDL,
    only nicer. 
    
    Takes an array, works out what unique values exist in this array. Provides
    a method which will return all the indexes into the original array for 
    a given value. 
    
    The array must be of an integer-like type. Floating point arrays will
    not work. If one needs to look at ranges of values within a float array,
    it is possible to use numpy.digitize() to create an integer array 
    corresponding to a set of bins, and then use ValueIndexes with that. 
    
    Example usage, for a given array a::

        valIndexes = ValueIndexes(a)
        for val in valIndexes.values:
            ndx = valIndexes.getIndexes(val)
            # Do something with all the indexes
    
    
    This is a much faster and more efficient alternative to something like::

        values = numpy.unique(a)
        for val in values:
            mask = (a == val)
            # Do something with the mask

    The point is that when a is large, and/or the number of possible values 
    is large, this becomes very slow, and can take up lots of memory. Each 
    loop iteration involves searching through a again, looking for a different 
    value. This class provides a much more efficient way of doing the same 
    thing, requiring only one pass through a. When a is small, or when the 
    number of possible values is very small, it probably makes little difference. 
    
    If one or more null values are given to the constructor, these will not 
    be counted, and will not be available to the getIndexes() method. This 
    makes it more memory-efficient, so it doesn't store indexes of a whole 
    lot of nulls. 
    
    A ValueIndexes object has the following attributes:
    
    * **values**            Array of all values indexed
    * **counts**            Array of counts for each value
    * **nDims**             Number of dimensions of original array
    * **indexes**           Packed array of indexes
    * **start**             Starting points in indexes array for each value
    * **end**               End points in indexes for each value
    * **valLU**             Lookup table for each value, to find it in the values array without explicitly searching. 
    * **nullVals**          Array of the null values requested. 
    
    Limitations:
    The array index values are handled using unsigned 32bit int values, so 
    it won't work if the data array is larger than 4Gb. I don't think it would
    fail very gracefully, either.
