"""
Module to implement filling of local minima in a raster surface. 

The algorithm is from 
    Soille, P., and Gratin, C. (1994). An efficient algorithm for drainage network
        extraction on DEMs. J. Visual Communication and Image Representation. 
        5(2). 181-189. 
        
The algorithm is intended for hydrological processing of a DEM, but is used by the 
Fmask cloud shadow algorithm as part of its process for finding local minima which 
represent potential shadow objects.
