"""
Generate an output image file with estimates of per-pixel angles for
sun and satellite azimuth and zenith. These are rough estimates, using the generic
characteristics of the Landsat 5 platform, and are not particularly accurate,
but good enough for the current purposes. 
In the future, the USGS have plans to distribute a set of parameters which can 
be used to directly generate these angles, derived from the actual orbit ephemeris
of the pass. This program is intended for use when these parameters are not 
available. Quite possibly, when they do make these available, I will modify this 
program to use those parameters if they are present in the MTL file, but fall back 
to the old estimates if not. 

The general approach for satellite angles is to estimate the nadir line by running it
down the middle of the image data area. The satellite azimuth is assumed to be
at right angles to this nadir line, which is only roughly correct. For the whisk-broom 
sensors on Landsat-5 and Landsat-7, this angles is not 90 degrees, but is affected by 
earth rotation and is latitude dependent, while for Landsat-8, the scan line is at 
right angles, due to the compensation for earth rotation, but the push-broom is 
made up of sub-modules which point in slightly different directions, giving 
slightly different satellite azimuths along the scan line. None of these effects
are included in the current estimates. The satellite zenith is estimated based on the
nadir point, the scan-line, and the assumed satellite altitude, and includes the
appropriate allowance for earth curvature. 

Because this works by searching the imagery for the non-null area, and assumes that 
this represents a full-swath image, it would not work for a subset of a full image. 

The sun angles are approximated using the algorithm found in the Fortran code with
6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum). The subroutine
in question is the POSSOL() routine. I translated the Fortran code into Python for
inclusion here.
