RIOS - Raster Input/Output Simplification

Rios is a set of Python modules aimed at simplifying the process of
writing Python programs which read and write raster files. It is built 
on top of GDAL (http://www.gdal.org). 

Rios is designed to handle the details of opening and closing
raster input and output files, ensuring alignment of projections and
raster grids, and to reduce memory requirements by supporting the reading
and processing of small blocks of the imagery. 

To install, please read the file INSTALL.txt.
