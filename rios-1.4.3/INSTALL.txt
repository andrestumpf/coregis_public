Simple installation instructions for RIOS. 

Requirements. 
-------------
    Numpy. 
    GDAL. This must include its python bindings. 

RIOS Installation steps, for Linux and similar. 
-----------------------------------------------
    1. Decide where you are going to install RIOS. This will be referred 
       to here as riosRoot. 
    2. tar xfz rios-m.n.tar.gz
    3. cd rios-m.n
    4. python setup.py install --prefix=riosRoot
    5. Add to your environment as follows
            Add riosRoot/bin to $PATH
            Add riosRoot/lib/pythonA.B/site-packages to $PYTHONPATH
       where pythonA.B refers to the version of python you are running. 

    6. Test the installation by executing the command 
           testrios.py

Environment Variables
---------------------
    All of these environment variables can be left un-set, as they all have sensible
    default values in the code. These are used to over-ride these defaults globally. 
    All values can also be over-ridden on a per-application basis, using the 
    applier controls object. 
    
    If you wish to use a default GDAL driver other than HFA, then set
    the environment variables, which are then given to GDAL
         RIOS_DFLT_DRIVER="short name of GDAL driver"
         RIOS_DFLT_CREOPT_<driver>="list of driver options (space-separated)"
    Variables of the form RIOS_DFLT_CREOPT_* can be used to set default creation
    options for any number of drivers.
    
    The deprecated form below will be applied only to the default driver. 
         RIOS_DFLT_DRIVEROPTIONS="list of driver options (space-separated)"
    
    To change the default behaviour when determining the footprint across multiple 
    input images
         RIOS_DFLT_FOOTPRINT=integer. default footprint setting, corresponding
                to values defined in imageio.py: INTERSECTION, UNION, BOUNDS_FROM_REFERENCE
    
    To change the default behaviour of RIOS's block-by-block processing. 
         RIOS_DFLT_BLOCKXSIZE=integer. Default value for X block size, in pixels. 
         RIOS_DFLT_BLOCKYSIZE=integer. Default value for Y block size, in pixels. 
         RIOS_DFLT_OVERLAP=integer. Default value for the margin around each block.
